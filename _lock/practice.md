### Absolute Beginner

A good place to start are the super cheep, transparent plastic locks. Keep in mind these are extremely easy. You will pick them in seconds and get a great confidence boost, but they won't really help you improve.

- [JAPI Set](https://amzn.to/31KK4a4) - a set of cheep picks, crappy tension tools, and plastic lock
- [6 Piece Set](https://amzn.to/2L0MbAA) - 6 locks in different form factor practice, includes 2 dimple locks

You will feel like a super hero, but get bored with these within 20 minutes.

### Next Step

Once you get bored with the toy locks, try these training sets for intermediate lock pickers:

- [Sparrow Cutaway Lock](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/cutawaystandard.htm) - a schlage style lock with standard pins
- [Sparrow Progressive Set](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/qprolok.htm) - 5 identical schlage locks, with progressively more standard pins
- [Sparrow Spool Pin Cutaway](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/cutawayspool.htm) - fantastic introduction to security spools
- [Sparrow Serrated Pin Cutaway](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/cutawayserrated.htm) - cut away lock with nasty serrated pins

The last two items on the list are a must have if you want to fully understand counter-rotation.

### IRL Locks

Some real life locks to use for practice:

- [Master Lock #3](https://amzn.to/2Kqx97J) - easy, sticky and greasy 4 pin garbage
- [Master Lock #7](https://amzn.to/2RpbRYX) - same as above, but tiny AF, to practice working in tight spaces
- [Master Lock 140](https://amzn.to/31IKGNb) - tackle spools IRL, master that counter-rotation
- [ABUS 64TI/50](https://amzn.to/2Rov2ly) - yale style keyway with warding, lots of spools
- [American Lock 1100](https://amzn.to/2J8nhfZ) - dark souls of lockpicking, spools, serrated pins, dead core, you will cry
