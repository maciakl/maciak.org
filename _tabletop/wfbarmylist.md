### What is this?

Here is the Excel spreadsheet I typically use when building Warhammer Fantasy 8th Ed armies. It comes with no instructions and no guarantees of correctness. It's just something I put together to make my own life easier.

You should be able to figure it out just by poking around. The **ppm** acronym stands for "points per model" which is part of WFB's Aldrich and arcane unit upgrade system.
