Note: all of these are specifically for Warhammer 8th Edition and below. I don't really play Age of Sigmar.

### Templates 

- [Standard Template Set](https://www.etsy.com/listing/448960958/warhammer-tournament-series-standard) - transparent large, small and flame template
- [Fallen Giant Template](https://ironheartartisans.com/shop/fallen-giant-template/) - acrylic, transparent regulation fallen giant template
- [Foot Template](https://ironheartartisans.com/shop/da-big-foot-template/) - transparent foot template for Waaagh! magic users

### Tokens

- [Wound Markers](https://ironheartartisans.com/shop/acrylic-wound-markers-set/) - nice wound markers, designed for square base models

### Movement Trays

By far the best choice here is the Tectonic Craft Studios. They are perhaps the best known for their laser cut terrain, and that's what you'll primarily see at their con booth, but their movement trays are fantastic. They are customizable, robust and perfect for any army:

Naturally, if you just want to cut your own out from cardboard, I recommend using my movement tray generator:
