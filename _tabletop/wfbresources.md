### Dice

This is warhammer so you have to buy in bulk. I like the 36 dice sets from Cheesex:

- [Cheesex Block of Dice](https://amzn.to/2RsjMVe) - nice block of 36 small dice

### Movement Trays

By far the best choice here is the Tectonic Craft Studios. They are perhaps the best known for their laser cut terrain, and that's what you'll primarily see at their con booth, but their movement trays are fantastic. They are customizable, robust and perfect for any army:

Naturally, if you just want to cut your own out from cardboard, I recommend using my movement tray generator:
