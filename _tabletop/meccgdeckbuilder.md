### What is this?

A deck builder for MECCG, partly inspired by services such as MTGPress. It allows you to type in a list of cards, and get printable, low resolution proxies for each of them. The site should be self explanatory. If you want to print the flaming eye card back just use the following in your list:

    1 Cardback

Also, always capitalize each word, in multi-word card names and never put hyphens in your list, even if the actual card has hyphen.

The service prints 4 cards per page. They are regulation 63mm x 88mm collectible card size.
