### Brushes

You need good brushes. Not only do they impact the quality of your work, they also impact quality of your life.

#### Basic Brushes

For your regular work horse brushes I recommend the Winsor & Newton Series 7 Kolinsky Sable brushes:

- [Winsor & Newton Series 7](https://amzn.to/2Foz3BI)

You will need for basic painting and detail work #1, #0, #00 and #000. You may also want to pick oup some larger ones for base-coating and ink application. 

Sometimes you may also want a trash set for experimenting with different paints, or doing rough work such as painting textured bases.

- [Humbrol AG4050](https://amzn.to/2Foz3BI) - nice cheep trash brushes for abrasive work

#### Detailer Brushes

When you need to paint eyes on your models:

- [TAMIYA 87153](https://amzn.to/2Rt2hnA) - a pointed ulta-fine brush for painting eyes and detail

- [The Army Painter Psycho](https://amzn.to/2Rt2hnA) - another super fine pointed detailer brush

#### Dry Brushes

You'll also need some siff synthetic bristle brushes for drybrushing work:

- [The Army Painter BR7015](https://amzn.to/2Rt2hnA) - a large flat brush

- [The Army Painter BR7010](https://amzn.to/2L5bJMY) - a large angled drybrush

-  [The Army Painter BR700](https://amzn.to/2Y58sRi) - a small angled drybrush

Drybrushing absolutely wrecks sable brushes. Synthetic holds up longer.
