### What is this?

When I was actively playing MTG I was making proxy token cards for friendly games with my friends. Those are the 1/1 trash creatures generated by spells or abilities of other summoned creatures. Most starter decks and fat packs will give you a handful of these, and they often come as filler in boosters, but if you are really min/maxing your deck and playing dirty, you need dozens of them to swarm the table. Thus I made a bunch of me and my friends because we got bored of having games with like 30 face down cards on the tables pretending to be zombies or goblins or what not.

I haven't played in a while, so all of these are from Dragons/Khans/Origins era.

All token sheets are provided as PDF files.
