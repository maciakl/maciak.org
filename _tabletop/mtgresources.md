### Card Sleeves

It's crucial to protect your cards, but at the same time you should rep your color. I was always partial to the iconic set:

- [Iconic Blue](https://amzn.to/2Y616x9)
- [Iconic Green](https://amzn.to/2Y616x9)
- [Iconic Black](https://amzn.to/2N3naXX)

### Tokens

It's best to make your own. LITKO has a great service where they will make you any token you want. I have used this in the past to make a dozen of +1/+1 tokens for stacking buffs:

### Proxies

- [Proxy Card Generator](http://www.mtgpress.net/) - print your own deck
- [Card Token Proxies](/tabletop/mtgtokens/) - my card token proxy set (pretty old by now)

### Other

- [Tower Deck Box](https://amzn.to/2Izr0DW) - nice deck box, with compartments for life counters and tokens
