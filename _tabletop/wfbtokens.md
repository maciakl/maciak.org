### What is this?

Bunch of printable tokens we use in our WFB games. The sheet includes "fleeing" markers (along with an arrow so you can indicate direction), wound markers, panic markers you can drop down so you don't forget to take these tests, fear and terror tokens, misfire tokens to indicate which war machines are out of commission for a turn, magical ward save indicators, and more.
