        <h3>Who are you?</h3>

        <p>My name is <a href="http://twitter.com/LukeMaciak">@LukeMaciak</a> and you should follow me on Twitter and also
        on <a href="https://github.com/maciakl">GitHub</a>. If you would like to find out more about my current projects 
        and publications you should check out my <em>other</em> homepage at <a href="http://maciak.net">maciak.net</a>.</p>

        <h3>What is this?</h3>

        <p>This is my secondary homepage I use to dump overflow projects, or useful tools and scripts which are too small to
        warrant a separate homepage. For example, I have uploaded a number of small windows utility tools in the 
        <a href="/win">Windows</a> section.

        <p>Please note that every tool is distributed <em>as is</em>, with no warranty. See the
        <a href="/disclaimer">disclaimer</a> for more details.</p>

        <p>Note: links leading off-site are marked with the <span class="ext">&raquo;</span> symbol.</p>
