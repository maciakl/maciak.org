        <h3>Lazy Way to Disapprove</h3>

        <p>I got tired of googling <em>"Look of Disapproval"</em> every time I
        wanted to express my displeasure in text so I made this bookmarklet.
        Feel free to use it for all your daily disapproving and table flipping
        needs.</p>

        <p>As far as I can tell, there is no equivalent bookmarklet out there.
        While there are dozens of sites that catalogue all kinds of smileys
        and emoji, few offer bookmarklets. There used to be a Chrome plugin that
        did this, but it got riddled with ads. So I made my own.</p>
