        <h3>Information</h3>
        <p>This website is my trove of various side projects, tools and utilities. It doesn't really have a 
        goal, mission statement or anything like that. Feel free to use whatever you find here.</p>	

        <h4>Linux</h4>

        <p>The Linux section contains useful scripts and packages you might be interested in. You can
        also find links to my dotfiles there.</p>

        <h4>Windows</h4>

        <p>Random assortment of utilities I have written over the years for various reasons. Most are
        command line tool wrappers I made for users afraid of the CLI.</p>

        <h4>Web</h4>

        <p>Random web based stuff that's to small to put anywhere else.</p>
