### Rules of Backup

1. If it's not automated it's not backup
1. If it's not nightly it's not backup
1. If it's not off-site, it'll get damaged with the computer
1. If it's not on-site, it won't be accessible when needed
1. If it's not tested, it will be corrupt when you need it

### Backup Service

Sign up for cloud backup service.

- [Carbonite](https://www.carbonite.com/backup-software/buy-carbonite-safe) ($6/mo) - does both cloud backup and on-site backup to external drive.

### Cloud Sync

Get cloud sync for your "work folders". Store your current projects there.

- [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) - cloud folder sync with roll-back feature.

You can use Dropbox to roll your files back to earlier state when you mess up. It's layman's version control.

### Off-line Sync

If you can't or won't use cloud, use a good file sync program to create backups:

- [Bvckup2](https://bvckup2.com/) - file sync without cloud ($20)

Remember to take media off-site or sync to a remote computer at a different location.
