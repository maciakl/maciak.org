Big name AV Suites like McAfee or Norton are garbage. Stay clear.

### Protection

It's worth spending money on good products.

- [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/) ($40/yr) - best protection / removal tool out there. Essential.
- [Zemana AntiLogger](https://www.zemana.com/en-US/AntiLogger) ($35/yr) - excellent level of protection. Good to have.
- [GlassWire](https://www.glasswire.com/) ($49) - software firewall. Turn on "Ask to Connect" feature. Nice to Have.
- [Microsoft Security Essentials](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14210/security-essentials-download) (free) - if you're running Windows 7. Run alongside Malwarebytes to quell down the AV warnings.

### Emergency Removal Tools

Use these to scan heavily infected systems:

- [Malwarebytes AdwCleaner](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/)
- [Microsoft Security Scanner](https://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx)
- [Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool](https://www.kaspersky.com/downloads/thank-you/free-virus-removal-tool?form=1)

### Other Tools

- [Luke's Setup Assistant](http://setupassistant.org) - always useful
