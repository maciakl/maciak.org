### What is this?

Markdown Journal is an open source, web based journaling application that integrates with the Dropbox cloud service.

The project was written in Ruby language and runs on the Sinatra framework.

The Dropbox integration is accomplished via the official Dropbox-SDK Gem.

Journal entries are saved in the Markdown file format in your own Dropbox account. Nothing is saved on the server.
