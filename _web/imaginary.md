### What is this?

A neat site that scrapes bunch of chosen art sharing subreddits and displays pictures found there as an infinite scrolling stream. This way you can look at a stream of inspirational fantasy art, without ever going to reddit.

### How was it made?

Most of the code is Javascript and utilizes Reddit and DeviantArt API to pull the images. It uses the following:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - for DOM building
- [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) - for scaffolding
- [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - for layout
- [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) - for building
