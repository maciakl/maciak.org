        <h3>Lazy Way to Disapprove</h3>

        <p>I got tired of googling <em>"Look of Disapproval"</em> every time I
        wanted to express my displeasure in text so I made this bookmarklet.
        Feel free to use it for all your daily disapproving and table flipping
        needs.</p>

        <p>As far as I can tell, there is no equivalent bookmarklet out there.
        While there are dozens of sites that catalogue all kinds of smileys
        and emoji, few offer bookmarklets. There used to be a Chrome plugin that
        did this, but it got riddled with ads. So I made my own.</p>


        <p><small>Drag the following link to the bookmarks bar:</small></p>
        
        <a class="btn btn-inverse btn-large" href="javascript: (function () {
                                    var jsCode = document.createElement('script');
                                    jsCode.setAttribute('src', 'https://maciak.org/lod.js');                 
                                    document.body.appendChild(jsCode);
                                    }());">
            &#3232;_&#3232;
            </a>
    </div>
