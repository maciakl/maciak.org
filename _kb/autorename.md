### Problem

Need a script that automatically changes the Windows computer name to match it's Dell Service Tag. Dell Service Tags are pretty unique and many people use them for asset tracking.

### Solution

Here is a Powershell script to rename and reboot the machine:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/maciakl/5094107.js"></script>

Run as Administrator obviously.
