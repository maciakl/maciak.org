### Who am I?

I am a person who makes things with computers on the internet. I play D&D, Warmachine, 40K, Malifaux, Frostgrave, Warhammer Fantasy, X-Wing, MECCG and bunch of other games.

### What is this?

This is a trash pile of garbage that I have made. You are welcome to it. There are also some links here, and some notes on things I found useful in the past.

Everything you download from here <em>as is</em>, with absolutely no warranty. Use at own peril.

Use the top bar menu to navigate the site.
