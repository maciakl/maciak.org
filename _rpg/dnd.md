<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

All of these are for iOS because that's what I use.

- [Fight Club 5](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fight-club-5th-edition/id901057473) - character sheet phone app for 5th ed (ignore the animu)
- [D20 Calculator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/d20-calculator/id817035968) - nice dice roller if you forgot your dice or something

Also, you can just say <em>"Hey Siri, roll a d20"</em> and she will.

<h3>Reference</h3>

- [Roll 20 Compendium](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex) - searchable compendium
- [Printable Spell Cards](http://dndns.azurewebsites.net/) - lets you select a list of spells and generates cards you can print out
