<h3>World Building Resources</h3>

Here are some tools I have used when world building or trying to flesh out a setting:

- [Flag Designer](https://flag-designer.appspot.com/) - simple flag design tool
- [Flag Maker](https://andrewsarnold.github.io/FlagMaker-Jr/) - a more complex flag design tool
- [Heraldry Creator](http://rpg.uplink.fi/heraldry/?template=main) - create coats of arms for knights and nobility
- [Map Drawing](http://inkarnate.com/) - online map drawing tool
- [Fantasy Calendar Generator](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/calendar/) - if you want to have non-standard calendar in your world


<h3>Game Prep Aids</h3>

- [Random Generators](https://donjon.bin.sh/) - a collection of generators for random generators for names, npcs, treasures, etc
- [Birthday Generator](https://wot7bday.glitch.me/) - randomly generates your birth day and sign (made for Will of the 7 Campaign setting)
