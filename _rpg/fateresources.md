### FATE Dice

The Evil Hat dice are really nice actually, but if you need something extra:

- [Metal Dice](https://www.norsefoundry.com/collections/metal-fate-dice) - get yourself a metal set
- [Fudge Dice](https://amzn.to/2Ya4O8U) - a big bag of dice for the table

### FATE Tokens

I got these metal tokens back when they were kickstarting the project and they are marvelous:

- [Fate Tokens](https://campaigncoins.com/fate-token-set-36/) - excellent metal tokens with FATE game logo and random + and - symbols (can be used instead of dice)

### Other Suff

- [GM Screen](http://tangentartists.storenvy.com/collections/1607625-fate-rpg/products/19744829-fate-accompli-gm-screen) - a FATE GM screen
- [Dry Erase Index Cards](https://amzn.to/2FvpvEQ) - reusable index cards (blank)
- [Fate Accompli Game Cards](http://tangentartists.storenvy.com/collections/1607625-fate-rpg/products/19744847-fate-accompli-dry-erase-game-cards-cool) - dry erase, pre-printed game cards designed for FATE
