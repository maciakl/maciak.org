### Minis

You can design your own mini in the browser and have it made to order via the magic of 3d printing:

- [Hero Forge](http://heroforge.com)

Alternatively, Wiz Kids has a fantastic line of unpainted miniatures licensed for D&D and Pathfinder so you can easily find your class/race combination:

- [WizKidz Unpainted Miniatures Catalog](https://wizkids.com/upm/)


### Phone Apps

All of these are for iOS because that's what I use.

- [Fight Club 5](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fight-club-5th-edition/id901057473) - character sheet phone app for 5th ed (ignore the animu)
- [D20 Calculator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/d20-calculator/id817035968) - nice dice roller if you forgot your dice or something

Also, you can just say <em>"Hey Siri, roll a d20"</em> and she will.

### Reference
