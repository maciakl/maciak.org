### What is this?

If you ever played an Arcane Trickster Rogue you have probably noticed that the default spell sheet is an overkill for this class. Half of it will always be empty, but at the same time there is not enough space to keep your class specific rules. This sheet is a redesign of the official spell sheet, made specifically with Arcane Trickster in mind.
